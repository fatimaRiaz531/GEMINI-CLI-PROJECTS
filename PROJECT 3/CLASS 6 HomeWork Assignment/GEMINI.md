# Gemini Project

project uses python + fastAPI.
All endpoints should be REST API.
Users will have name, pin_number and bank_number.
We need three endpoints: /authenticatte, / deposit, / bank-transfer.
Use an in-memory dictionary to store users.
Always return Json responses.

This is a project-level file for Gemini-related documentation and information.
